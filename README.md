# **THE** Messaging App
### Before we get into the code, please read the following notes thoroughly:
- This is a **SERVERLESS** Messaging App, which means it's a shell app, you can send messages to shell accounts without expecting a reply.
- The purpose of this app is to illustrate how working on a server to run apps is only half of the problem, handling UI and the visuals are other beasts of their own.
- This App uses the library `Electron.js`, so if you are interested in running the code from the terminal and not the executable, please check this [section](#how-to-run-it-from-the-terminal) 
- Due to the short timeframe I had to test, I was not able to kill all bugs, but generally speaking, the user experience should be smooth.
- The `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files are **NOT** be included in this file, and you won't be able to run this project from the terminal without them, please check [this](#how-to-run-it-from-the-terminal) for more information
